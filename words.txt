# <a name="title"></a> Speed Typing ### Introduction After reaching 130 WPM from constant speed typing training, I figured I would make my own speed typing program with custom input to maximize educational value. ### Usage #### Setup 1 - Clone the master repository (```git clone https://github.com/Sebastian-git/SpeedTyping.git```) <br> 2 - (Optional) Check if all [libraries](#Launch) are up to date with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (```pip install [package_name] --upgrade```) <br> 3 - (Optional) Set up a custom ```words.txt``` file using the ```script.py``` file, instructions below <br> Now, you are ready to begin improving your typing skills! #### Customization (script.py) With the addition of ```script.py```, users can appreciate a speed typing game with a custom set of words. The technical information for the quick script is displayed in detail [below](#Technical Information). <br> Follow the given steps to create a custom data set to type to: <br> 1 - Put the desired content into a `.txt` file <br> 2 - On line 4 of `script.py`, set file_name equal to the text file (`file_name = [file.txt]`) <br> 3 - Run script.py, which will parse the content to be readable by the main program <br> <br> The content will be written to words.txt, and will now be displayed when the program is run! ##### Previews (1) The program will display the words to type at the top, highlight the last word typed, and shows the timer at the bottom <br> <img width="1000" height="600" alt="portfolio_view" src="https://github.com/Sebastian-git/SpeedTyping/blob/master/imgs/Screenshot_2.png"> <br><br> (2) A fun example of using the `script.py` file is on the program itself! Here is an example of what it looks like when loaded <br> <img width="1000" height="600" alt="portfolio_view" src="https://github.com/Sebastian-git/SpeedTyping/blob/master/imgs/Screenshot_1.png"> <br> ##### Technical Information The script.py file ``` py ``` ### Launch Python 3.9.0 <br> TKinter, Threading, Time <br> VS Code 1.48, <br> ### Status: Complete #### [back to the top](#title)
